<h1> Learning HTML: The Basics </h1> <p style="text-align:right;"> A Self Reference by Arys Aung </p> 
<hr>
<p> HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language, and it's essentially compromised of two elements. Taglines and Regular Text. </p>

<h2> Tags or Regular Text </h2>
<p> Tags always exist in pairs and are written as "< p > ... < /p >." The regular text exists in between the tags, which serve as your titles, paragraphs, and headings. The tags serve as instructions.

<h2 style="color:blue;" > Specific Tags </h2>
<p> Each tag specifies an action. After all, we must remember <mark> HTML tags serve as instructions. </mark> Here's a <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_attributes.asp" target="_blank" >list of special actions</a> <b> Overall, this <a href="http://wwww.w3schools.com" target="_blank" >website</a> is an amazing reference point for all types of coding, especially Front-End: HTML, CSS, JQuery, and Javascript. </b>

<b> NEVER FORGET TO CLOSE YOUR TAG </b> </p>

<h2> Building a Code Sheet </h2> 
<h3 style="color:orange;"> Necessities: Sublime Text & Google Chrome </h3>
<p> The Organization of HTML code begins as a simple instruction log.
You <i> must </i> begin with a simple straight foward "< doctype HTML >" in order to inform Sublime Text, that this is in fact an HTML code.
As you move onward, you can then being "< head > ... < /head >," which will title the code for <mark> only </mark> the coder to see. Similar to the notes section of a word document. In between your head tags, you will create a tag for title, which titles the code.
<br>
<br>
Now you will begin to code the parts of the website that are actually visible to the viewer. After you close your head tag from earlier, you will then begin a body tag ( follow procedures for tags ) After which, you will then be able to create heading tags using h1 to h6, h1 being the strongest. Then after your heading, you can then create paragraphs using the p tag format. 
<p style="color:green; display:inline;" >You can then customize colors and 
<p style="color:pink; display:inline" > style as much as you want.

  <p>I have lived my life under many different names: Ye Min Hein, Jonathan Hein, Shin Wathawa, Kaung Myat Tun Aung, Jonathan Aung, and now, Arys Aung. Each name has represented a chapter in my life. Each chapter building on the chapter before it.
    <br> <br>
Ye Min Hein - the name, given to me at birth by Buddhist monks, translates to "brave, stark king." Ironically, six years later, my family and I fled Burma to escape a military dictatorship. In our attempts to assimilate into American culture, I was asked to pick between Jonathan and Arthur as a new first name. The transition to Jonathan, for a six-year-old child, was unsurprisingly easy. Quickly adapting to my name, I began to respond to "Jonathan," but I never identified with the name. Little did I know the choice of "Jonathan" started a long game of role-play and make-believe, which would eventually stretch for a little over a decade.
<br> <br>
  It wasn't until my ordination as a Buddhist monk that I realized the discomfort I had with the name "Jonathan." I was practicing my Burmese rituals and prayers when I came across a wild cat. She ran rampant through the monastery, and in a selfish desire for attention, she knocked over anything she could get its paws on, resulting in huge messes. The monks never addressed the cat by its name, only shooing or motioning the cat away. When I questioned this seemingly ineffective practice, the monks educated me on the dual concept of names and ownership. As a monk, we were required to release all desires and material possessions. To impose our name on the cat would be to impose our ownership on it - to possess it. I realized that when I chose "Jonathan" several years prior, I had confined myself to a name and a name that I did not resonate with. When I left the monastery, I left with invaluable lessons that shaped who I would eventually become.
  <br> <br>
  In Western Political Theory, we discussed the name Aristotle and its etymology. Aris meant "the best," and totle meant "end/purpose."In the spur of a eureka moment, I came across the name "Arys" serendipitously. I wanted my name to align with my character and intentions. So I took the creative liberty and changed Aris to Arys, and now, the name I have given myself is Arys Aung. In literal translation it roughly means "the best strides towards success." Self-improvement is an essential ingredient of my mantra, and as a result, I believe my name should embody that motif as well. Ultimately, I began to realize that before I could continue to improve on myself, I have to love and cherish who I am - who I am becoming.
  <br> <br>
Buddhism taught me that to name something was to impose my ownership on it - to possess it. But it wasn't until I realize that my name is my identity: something I align by. The monks forgot that to name something was to cherish it for what it was and to recognize the potential for what it could be. I am proud to be able to say that I have finally named myself.
